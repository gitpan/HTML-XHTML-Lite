HTML-XHTML-Lite version 0.01
============================

INTRODUCTION

This module provides a light-weight alternative to the Perl built-in,
CGI.pm, for those who wish for an easy way to produce a well-formed 
XHTML <head></head>, with Dublin Core metadata. A function to create 
a footer is provided for completeness and it is even possible to 
provide body text to return a complete document.  Provision is made 
for the inclusion of links to RSS (or other) feeds and FOAF data.  
The 'extras' property allows for the insertion of arbitrary elements 
into the document header.

In addition to the generation of XHTML, the function getvars() is 
included to populate a hash with data from the query string and POST 
data.  This is an unsophisticated equivalent to CGI.pm's 
$q->para('xyz') functionality.

The aim of this module is to help produce content that is both 
accessible and machine-parseable.  For instance, one of the methods 
of start_page(), nodoctype=>1, is provided purely for the purpose of 
being able to leave out required components to check that any 
validation systems being used are actually working.

For further information, please see the documentation.
